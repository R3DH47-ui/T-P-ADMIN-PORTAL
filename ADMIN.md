## 1. Project Overview
The **RIMT Institutional Portal** is an enterprise-grade administrative and academic placement platform. It connects university officers, placement coordinators, corporate recruiters, and students in a unified ecosystem. 

A core architectural pillar is the **Gated Student Onboarding System & Administrator Oversight**:
- All new student registrations enter a strict `PENDING` queue.
- No access token or home portal permissions are granted upon registration.
- An Administrator manually reviews the student's identity, roll number, department, and academic year in the **Onboarding Approvals** queue.
- Administrators can inspect a comprehensive **LinkedIn-Style Scholar Dossier** containing student bio, legal name, phone number, academic score (CGPA & SGPA breakdown), featured projects portfolio, and verified credentials vault.
- Upon **Approval**, the student is granted full access to the portal dashboard, document vault, and profile editor.
- Upon **Rejection**, the student is locked out with an official registrar reason displayed on their screen.
- **Revocation** is separate from rejection; an administrator can remove an approved student's access with a recorded reason.
- **Fixed Admin Access Policy:** Open admin signup is permanently eliminated. Only two pre-authorized administrators are permitted: **Raj Kumar** (HOD BCA) and **Sagrika** (Vice HOD BCA) using salted PBKDF2 credentials.
- Approval totals and student registration views are computed from Supabase rows submitted by the student app. Student registration views do not seed profiles or invent missing fields.
- The mobile app's live Supabase schema uses `name` and `roll_no`; admin-facing records normalize these to `full_name` and `roll_number` while retaining both aliases. Do not assume the phone app writes to the admin process's in-memory fallback.
- Real-time guards block `PENDING`, `REJECTED`, and `REVOKED` accounts. The app rechecks approved sessions every 3.5 seconds.

### Cross-Project Upload Architecture (Cloudinary):
- The admin portal hosts a **Cloudinary Signing Endpoint** at `POST /api/cloudinary/sign` that generates SHA-1 upload signatures for the mobile app.
- The mobile app calls this endpoint to upload certificates and documents directly to Cloudinary, keeping the `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` safe on the server side.
- CORS headers allow `*` origins so both the admin web portal and the physical mobile device can call the endpoint.
- The admin portal's `.env` holds `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.
- The mobile app's `.env` sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_SIGNING_URL` to the admin portal's LAN/deployed URL (e.g., `http://<LAN_IP>:3000/api/cloudinary/sign` for local dev).

## 2. Tech Stack

| Domain | Technology | Configuration & Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin Web Portal** | Next.js 16.3.8 (App Router) + React 18.3.1 | Single-Page Responsive Institutional Shell with 3-State Sidebar |
| **Styling & Design System** | Tailwind CSS 3.4.19 | Custom institutional palette: Primary Maroon (`#6B0018`), Gold (`#E7B94A`), Desert Surfaces (`#FAF6F0`) |
| **Icons & Micro-UI** | Lucide React (`^0.424.0`) + Material Symbols (self-hosted WOFF2/TTF) | Clean SVG vector iconography with local font-face binding |
| **Student Mobile/Web App** | Expo SDK 57 + React Native 0.86.3 | Cross-platform student app in `c:\Users\r3dha\APP-RIMIT-(2)` |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL via Supabase (`pwghazyfxhypzkadqfnn`) | Source of truth for student registrations and review states |
| **Admin DB writes** | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-only secret required to bypass student-facing RLS for review-state writes |
| **Backend API Layer** | Next.js Route Handlers (`src/app/api/*`) | Serverless microservice architecture for Auth, Approvals, Profile, Cloudinary Signing |
| **Authentication & Cryptography** | Standard Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) + Node.js `crypto` | PBKDF2/SHA-256 salted password hashing, HMAC-SHA256 JWT tokens, SHA-1 Cloudinary signatures |
| **File Uploads** | Cloudinary (server-signed) | Upload signature generation via `/api/cloudinary/sign`; API secret never exposed to client |
| **Realtime Sync** | `@supabase/supabase-js` Realtime | Bidirectional PostgreSQL change subscriptions for all dossier tables |

## 4. All Admin Screens & Views

### 4.1 Onboarding Approvals (`src/views/OnboardingApprovals.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** Primary review queue for new student registrations before they are granted portal entry.
- **Features:**
  - Metric cards showing counts for **Awaiting Review (Pending)**, **Approved**, **Rejected**, and **Total**.
  - Department filter dropdown (BCA, B.Sc IT, B.Sc Cyber Security, B.Sc (Hons) AI & ML).
  - Real-time search by full name, roll number, or department.
  - Pending, approved, rejected, revoked, and total counts derive from the complete live Supabase response.
  - Database read failures are shown as sync errors, not as confirmed zero counts.
  - Table showing Student Details, Department & Semester, Timestamp, and Status badge.
  - Quick actions: **Approve**, **Reject** with reason, and **Revoke Access** with its own reason for approved accounts.
  - Detailed review drawer showing full student credentials.
  - Rejection modal with predefined institutional reasons and custom text input.
  - Live toast alerts on status transitions.
  - A visible queue record does not guarantee the server can write a review decision. If an approve/reject/revoke call returns `Student record not found`, check that the row ID matches the Supabase row and that `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is configured on the admin server; the in-memory fallback is process-local and is not shared with the mobile app.

### 4.2 Student Management (`src/views/StudentManagement.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** Student-registration directory backed by live Supabase records with comprehensive LinkedIn-Style Profile Tracking.
- **Features:**
  - **LinkedIn-Style Scholar Dossier:** Full modal and drawer view displaying scholar bio, legal name, headline, phone number, academic score (CGPA & SGPA breakdown), featured projects portfolio, and verified credentials vault.
  - **Document Vault & Previewer:** Live integration with `student_documents` table in Supabase; includes one-click in-modal document preview (PDF/Image) and verified credential badges.
  - **Academic Score Tracker:** Real-time tracking of cumulative CGPA (out of 10.0), percentage equivalence, semester-by-semester SGPA track, and Dean's Honors List academic standing.
  - **Featured Projects Portfolio:** GitHub-synced project cards showing category, tech stack tags, commit metadata, and demo links.
  - **Direct Admin Actions:** Direct click-to-call, WhatsApp chat, email, and live override/editing of scholar bio, phone, and academic metrics (`PATCH /api/admin/requests/[id]`).
  - Live totals and filters for status, department, and year/semester.
  - CSV export contains the currently filtered live records. Legacy add/import controls do not claim unsaved records succeeded.

### 4.3 Talent Showcase (`src/views/CompanyManagement.jsx` — formerly Company Management)
- **Purpose:** Recruiter-facing gallery of approved RIMT student portfolios with profile strength scoring. Designed for corporate recruiters browsing the RIMT Talent pool.
- **Features:**
  - **Profile Strength Scoring:** Automated 0–100% profile completeness score computed from bio, headline, avatar, skills, projects, certificates, and internships. Students classified as **Exceptional** (≥85%), **Strong** (≥65%), **Developing** (≥45%), or **Starter** (<45%).
  - **Live Supabase Data:** Fetches all `APPROVED`/`VERIFIED` students via `/api/admin/requests?status=ALL` with 8-second auto-refresh polling.
  - **Filter Pills:** All Talent, Exceptional, Strong, Projects, Internships, Certified.
  - **Department Filter:** Dropdown to filter by BCA, B.Sc IT, B.Sc Cyber Security, B.Sc (Hons) AI & ML.
  - **Sort Options:** By profile strength, name (A-Z), project count, or most recent.
  - **Grid/List View Toggle:** Card-based grid view and compact list view.
  - **Student Portfolio Cards:** Display avatar, name, headline, department, roll number, skills tags, project/internship/certificate counts, and profile strength progress bar.
  - **TalentProfileModal:** Read-only full-screen student portfolio viewer (`src/components/student/TalentProfileModal.jsx`) showing About section, Tech Stack & Skills, Featured Projects, Certificates, Internships, and profile strength gauge. Designed for recruiter consumption — no admin editing capabilities.
  - **Search:** Full-text search by name, roll number, department, headline, or skill name.

### 4.4 Drive Management (`src/views/DriveManagement.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** Placement drive scheduling and applicant tracking.
- **Features:**
  - Drive dates, job descriptions, compensation breakdown, and eligibility criteria.
  - Registered applicant list and shortlisted student counters.

### 4.5 Placement Statistics (`src/views/PlacementStatistics.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** Institutional analytics dashboard with live student placement and corporate hiring data.
- **Features:**
  - Placement percentage by department.
  - Highest, median, and average package (LPA) benchmarks.
  - Visual charts and historical comparison trends.
  - **Placed Students & Corporate Offers Card** (`src/components/placement/PlacedStudentsCard.jsx`):
    - Lists all approved students paired with hiring companies from `src/lib/placementStats.js`.
    - **Student Profession Badge:** Each student displays a color-coded profession pill with matching icon (🛡 Cyber Security → emerald, ☁ Cloud DevOps → sky, 💻 Developer → indigo, 📊 Risk Analyst → amber, 🏦 FinTech → teal, 🎶 Music/Singing → purple, 💃 Dance → pink) via `getProfessionBadge()`.
    - **Official Company Brand Logos:** Uses `CompanyBrandLogo` SVG vectors (Google, Microsoft, AWS, Deloitte, HDFC, TCS) instead of external image URLs — immune to CORS/403 errors.
    - **Tier Badges:** Packages color-coded by tier: Super Dream (≥15 LPA), Dream (≥10 LPA), Standard 1 (≥6 LPA), Entry.
  - **Hiring Companies Section** (`src/components/placement/HiringCompaniesSection.jsx`):

    - Location badges link to Google Maps search for the company address.
    - Shows SPOC contact, MoU status, package range, and sector info.

### 4.6 Training Management (`src/views/TrainingManagement.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** Pre-placement soft-skills and technical training bootcamps.
- **Features:**
  - Training modules, schedule calendar, and student attendance tracking.

### 4.7 Internship Monitoring (`src/views/InternshipMonitoring.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** 6-month industrial internship tracking.
- **Features:**
  - Assigned mentor faculty, mid-term evaluations, and compliance reports.

### 4.8 Report Generation (`src/views/ReportGeneration.jsx`)
- **Purpose:** Institutional reporting for NAAC, NIRF, and AICTE compliance.
- **Features:**
  - Export placement reports in CSV and PDF formats.

### 6.3 Security, Row Level Security (RLS) & Helper Functions
```sql
-- Helper function to identify active administrators
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.admins
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
    )
    OR (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'ADMIN'
    OR (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'service_role'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Helper function to identify current student
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.current_student_id()
RETURNS UUID AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (auth.jwt() ->> 'sub')::UUID;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**RLS Policy Rules:**
1. **Admins:** Full permissions (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on all dossier and academic tables via `public.is_admin()`.
2. **Students:** Read-only (`SELECT`) on their own records only (`student_id = public.current_student_id() AND is_visible = true`).
3. **No Student Writes:** Absolutely **no** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` policies exist for students on any dossier or academic table.
4. **Audit Log:** Insert-only and read-only for admins (`is_admin()`). Completely inaccessible to students.

### 6.4 Private Storage Bucket: `student-certificates`
- **Bucket ID:** `student-certificates` (Private, `public = false`)
- **File Limit:** 10MB maximum per file.
- **Allowed MIME Types:** `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`.
- **Access Protocol:** Signed URLs generated on-demand by backend API (`db.getSignedCertificateUrl`).
- **Storage RLS:** Admins have full access; students can only download objects where they own the associated visible certificate record.

### 6.5 Companies Table (In-Memory + Supabase)
```sql
-- Company / Corporate Recruiter accounts (in-memory store with Supabase persistence)
-- Schema used by initCompanyDb(), getCompanyByEmail(), getCompanyById(), createCompany(), getAllCompanies()
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.companies (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                        -- e.g. 'comp-1791354383460-9f8ey'
  company_name TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- e.g. 'Google LLC'
  recruiter_name TEXT NOT NULL,               -- e.g. 'Google Campus Talent'
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,                 -- Normalized lowercase corporate email
  password_hash TEXT,                         -- PBKDF2-SHA256 hash (NULL for Google OAuth accounts)
  auth_provider TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'email', -- 'email' | 'google'
  industry TEXT DEFAULT 'Corporate Recruitment', -- e.g. 'Cloud & AI Technology'
  avatar_url TEXT,                            -- UI Avatars fallback or custom avatar
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'COMPANY',        -- Always 'COMPANY'
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE',        -- 'ACTIVE' | 'DISABLED'
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Default Seeded Companies (via `initCompanyDb()` in `db.js`):**
| ID | Company | Email | Auth Provider | Industry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `comp-google-001` | Google LLC | `recruiter@google.com` | google | Cloud & AI Technology |
| `comp-msft-002` | Microsoft Corporation | `recruiter@microsoft.com` | google | Enterprise Software & Azure |
| `comp-tcs-003` | Tata Consultancy Services | `campus@tcs.com` | email | IT Consulting & Services |

**Default Password:** `Company@RIMT#2026` (PBKDF2-SHA256, salt: `rimt-salt-key`, 10,000 iterations)

## 7. Admin-Managed Student Dossier & Strict Manual Academic Control Specification

### 7.1 Architecture & The 7 Dossier Sections
The Student Dossier (`StudentDossierModal.jsx`) provides a unified, structured control center for administrators, accessible from both `StudentManagement.jsx` ("Open Dossier" button on each row) and `OnboardingApprovals.jsx`:
1. **Overview:** Student hero banner, official avatar, legal name, roll number, department, batch, status badge, contact details (phone, address, portfolio URLs), narrative bio, and professional skills tags.
2. **Projects:** Custom featured projects with title, role, dates, tech stack tags, repository/demo URLs, visibility toggle (`is_visible`), and drag-and-drop sort order.
3. **Git Projects:** Tracked GitHub repositories with language badges, stars, forks, repo URLs, and visibility controls.
4. **Certificates:** Verified credentials with issuing organization, issue/expiration dates, credential ID/URL, file upload to private `student-certificates` bucket, signed URL previewer, and visibility controls.
5. **Internships:** Industry training records with company name, role, status (`ongoing`, `completed`, `offered`), dates, stipend, mentor details, and visibility controls. Synchronized with `InternshipMonitoring.jsx`.
6. **Academics:** Comprehensive manual academic control panel featuring:
   - **Cumulative Summary:** CGPA (0.00 – 10.00), Overall Attendance % (0.00 – 100.00), Active Backlogs count, Total Credits Earned, and Registrar Remarks.
   - **Semester Records:** Semester-by-semester SGPA, attendance percentage, credits registered, and credits earned.
   - **Subject Grade Roster:** Tabular grid to enter subject codes, subject names, letter grades (O, A+, A, B+, B, C, P, F, AB), and numeric grade points.
7. **Activity Log:** Real-time tamper-evident audit trail read from `admin_audit_log`, displaying timestamp, actor name, action performed, entity modified, and JSON old vs. new diff.

### 7.2 Strict Manual-Only Academic Policy (Anti-Automation Policy)
Per institutional governance and registrar guidelines:
- **Exclusively Admin-Authored:** CGPA, overall attendance %, backlogs, semester SGPA, and subject grades are written **exclusively by human administrators**.
- **Zero Automated Derivation:** There are **NO** database triggers, **NO** background cron recalculations, **NO** edge functions, and **NO** client-side automated average computations.
- **Independence of Fields:** Modifying or adding a subject grade does **NOT** recalculate or overwrite semester SGPA or cumulative CGPA. Adding attendance elsewhere does **NOT** overwrite stored attendance.
- **Unset Values Display "—":** Missing or unset academic values display strictly as a dash (`—`). The system never seeds fake default scores (such as 0 or 8.65).
- **Client & Server Boundary Validation:**
  - `CGPA`: Numeric between `0.00` and `10.00`.
  - `Attendance`: Numeric between `0.00` and `100.00`.
  - `Backlogs`: Non-negative integer (`>= 0`).
  - `Credits`: Non-negative numeric (`>= 0`).
- **Confirm-Before-Save Modal:** Any changes to academic fields trigger a modal displaying an **Old Value vs. New Value** comparison diff that requires explicit administrator confirmation before persisting.
- **Audit Logging:** Every academic change commits a row to `admin_audit_log` with `old_values` and `new_values`.

### 7.3 Automation Removed / Disabled
1. **Hash-Based Fake CGPA:** Removed `8.15 + (hashSum % 170) / 100` synthetic CGPA derivation from `src/lib/db.js`.
2. **Hardcoded Fallbacks:** Removed `data.cgpa || 8.65` fallback from `src/lib/db.js` and UI modals.
3. **Synthetic Attendance Percentage:** Removed hardcoded `94.8%` attendance fallback from `src/views/StudentManagement.jsx`.
4. **Auto-Calculated SGPA:** Removed synthetic semester score averaging scripts.

### 7.4 Cross-Module Integrations
- **`StudentManagement.jsx`:** Added live `CGPA` and `Attendance` table columns, "Open Dossier" button on every row, live CGPA/attendance badges in the detail drawer, and mounted `<StudentDossierModal>`. Data is fed directly from `student_academic_summary` via `getAllStudentAcademicSummaries()`.
- **`InternshipMonitoring.jsx`:** Wired to `/api/admin/internships` to display live industrial internships created or updated in the dossier.
- **`ReportGeneration.jsx` & Placement Statistics:** Consume `student_academic_summary`, `student_semester_records`, and `student_grades` as-is with zero recomputation.

### 7.5 Assumptions & Policy Decisions (Resolved §14)
1. **Student Write Access:** Students have **zero write access** to dossier and academic tables (enforced by RLS and API boundaries).
2. **Non-Approved Students:** Pending, Rejected, and Revoked students are read-only; dossier editing is restricted to Approved scholars.
3. **Grade Scale:** Supports both free-text letter grades (e.g., `A+`) and numeric grade points (e.g., `9.00`).
4. **Deletions:** Hard delete with automatic logging in `admin_audit_log`.

---

## 8. Immediate Session Revocation & Lockout Strategy
To ensure that an active session is revoked **immediately** when an administrator rejects or bars a student:
1. **Live Database Status Verification:** The `withAuth` route guard does **not** rely solely on static JWT token claims. On every authenticated API call, it queries the database for the user's live status.
2. **Immediate 403 Response:** If the user's status is `REJECTED`, `REVOKED`, or `PENDING`, the request is halted with `HTTP 403 Forbidden` (`ACCOUNT_REJECTED`, `ACCOUNT_REVOKED`, or `ACCOUNT_PENDING`).
3. **Reactive Client Eviction:** Both web and mobile applications immediately clear cached credentials upon receiving a 403 status revocation and transition the user to the `RejectedScreen` or `PendingApprovalScreen`.

## 11. Changelog
- **2026-10-07 (Company Sidebar Locked Tabs Removal, Multi-Account Chooser Isolation, and Balanced Auth Gateway Status):**
  1. **Company Sidebar Cleanup (Problem 1 Solved):**
     - Updated `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` navigation renderer: When `userRole === 'COMPANY'`, `navItems` is strictly filtered with `companyAllowedModules.includes(item.id)`.
     - In the left sidebar under "Core Modules", corporate recruiters now only see the 2 modules they have access to: **Company Management** and **Placement Statistics**. All 6 locked/restricted modules (Onboarding Approvals, Student Management, Drive Management, Training Management, Internship Monitoring, Report Generation) are completely removed from the DOM.
  2. **Profile Menu Multi-Account Switcher Role Isolation (Problem 2 Solved):**
     - In `src/components/profile/ProfileMenu.jsx`, filtered `otherAccounts` strictly by account role (`isCompany ? accIsCompany : !accIsCompany`).
     - Corporate recruiters logged in as a company now only see other corporate company accounts in the "Switch Account" menu (admin accounts like Raj Kumar or Sagrika are completely filtered out).
     - Administrators logged in now only see other administrator accounts in the "Switch Account" menu (company accounts like Microsoft or Google are completely filtered out).
     - "Add another account" dynamically routes to `/company/auth` for company recruiters and `/admin/add-account` for administrators.
     - Updated `handleSwitchAccount` in `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.jsx` to seamlessly support switching into company accounts via `companyLogin` credential fallback.
  3. **Auth Screen Multi-Account Chooser Isolation & Balanced Gateway Status (Problem 3 Solved):**
     - In `src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx`, strictly segmented saved accounts into `adminSavedAccounts` and `companySavedAccounts`.
     - **Institutional Admin Gateway:** The "Choose an account" screen now only renders authorized administrator accounts (`Raj Kumar`, `Sagrika`). Corporate company accounts are completely filtered out.
     - **Company Portal Gateway:** Introduced a dedicated corporate account chooser that only renders corporate company accounts (`Microsoft Corporation`, `Google LLC`, `TCS`). Institutional admin accounts are completely filtered out.
     - **Balanced Gateway Status:** Replaced the asymmetric, redundant second-row switch button (`Administrative Access Gateway` on left vs `Company Access ->` on right) with a clean, beautifully centered, balanced gateway status indicator badge with micro-status pills for both Institutional Admin and Corporate Recruiter gateways.
     - Full automated test suite passing (63/63 tests) and Next.js Turbopack production build verified cleanly.
- **2026-10-07 (Student Profession Badges, Official SVG Company Logos in Placed Students Card, Multi-Account Session Isolation, Corporate Logos & Gmail-Style Account Chooser):**
  1. **Student Profession Badges in Placed Students Card:**
     - Added `getProfessionBadge()` function to `src/components/placement/PlacedStudentsCard.jsx` — returns distinct icon + color badge for each profession category:
       - 🛡 **Cyber Security** → emerald green (`shield` icon)
       - ☁ **Cloud / DevOps / AWS / Azure** → sky blue (`cloud` icon)
       - 💻 **Developer / SDE / Full Stack / Software** → indigo (`code` icon)
       - 💃 **Dance / Dancer** → pink (`directions_walk` icon)
       - 🎶 **Singing / Music / Artist** → purple (`music_note` icon)
       - 📊 **Risk / Consultant / Analyst** → amber (`query_stats` icon)
       - 🏦 **FinTech / Finance / Banking** → teal (`account_balance` icon)
       - 🏷 **Default** → slate (`badge` icon)
     - Each student row now displays their profession as a colorful pill badge next to their verified checkmark.
     - Profession data flows from `src/lib/placementStats.js` → `getHiringPairForStudent()` → `getLivePlacedStudents()` → `item.student.profession`.
  2. **Official SVG Company Logos in Placed Students Card:**
     - Replaced external `logoUrl` image tags and generic Material Symbol fallbacks with `<CompanyBrandLogo company={item.company} />` — self-contained SVG vectors.
     - Created `src/components/common/CompanyBrandLogo.jsx` with official vector logos for Google, Microsoft, AWS, Deloitte, HDFC Bank, TCS, L&T, Infosys, and Wipro. Dynamic monogram fallback for unknown companies.
     - All SVGs are inline, responsive, CORS-immune, and never 403 on external hotlinks.
  3. **Enhanced Profession Resolution in `placementStats.js`:**
     - Added dynamic profession detection for diverse BCA/BSc specializations and custom talents (dancers, singers, musicians, etc.).
     - Fallback profession is now department-aware: Cyber Security dept → `Cyber Security Specialist`, IT dept → `Enterprise IT Systems Engineer`, BCA/Computer dept → `Full Stack Software Developer`.
     - Custom student professions (from `student.profession`, `student.headline`, or `student.bio`) are preserved and take priority.
  4. **Fixed Session Reversion Bug (Sagrika → Raj Kumar):**
     - Diagnosed and resolved root cause where clicking actions as administrator **Sagrika** reverted session to **Raj Kumar**.
     - In `src/lib/middleware.js`, updated `extractToken(req)` to prioritize the explicit `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header over stale client cookies.
     - In `withAuth`, verified individual JWT tokens and bound `req.user` to the decoded administrator identity before evaluating development fallback logic (`isPortalAdmin`), preventing `x-admin-portal: true` headers from hardcoding `Raj Kumar`.
     - In `src/lib/authApi.js` (`getAdminMe`) and `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.jsx`, added active session matching guards (`isSameAdminAccount`) so background authentication revalidations cannot overwrite the currently active administrator.
  5. **Official Corporate Brand Vector Logos (Hiring Companies Section):**
     - Replaced generic Material Symbol placeholder icons with authentic, high-fidelity SVG brand logos in `src/components/placement/HiringCompaniesSection.jsx`:
       - **Google India Pvt Ltd:** Official 4-color Google "G" vector logo.
       - **Microsoft Corporation India:** Official 4-color square vector logo.
       - **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Official AWS smile arrow vector badge.
       - **Deloitte USI:** Official Deloitte wordmark with lime green dot.
       - **HDFC Bank Ltd:** Official blue & red geometric cross grid logo.
       - **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS):** Official Tata blue brand emblem.
       - Built-in vector support for **L&T**, **Infosys**, and **Wipro**, plus dynamic monogram fallbacks.
     - Embedded SVGs are completely self-contained, fully responsive, and immune to external CORS/Wikimedia 403 hotlink errors.
  6. **Gmail-Style Account Chooser & 1-Click Sign-In:**
     - In `src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx`, introduced a **Gmail-Style Account Chooser** screen when remembered accounts exist on the device.
     - Displays avatar, name, email, and role badge (`HOD BCA`, `Vice HOD BCA`).
     - **1-Click Instant Sign-In:** Clicking an account signs in immediately without repeatedly typing username and password.
     - Includes "Use another account" button to toggle manual credential form, and "Remove an account" device management.
  7. **Multi-Account Dropdown & Session Preservation:**
     - In `AuthGuard.jsx`, `handleSignOut` preserves accounts in `rimt_admin_accounts` instead of deleting them.
     - In `ProfileMenu.jsx`, dynamically lists other logged-in accounts under the active session header with 1-click switching.
     - Fixed `isSameAdminAccount` in `src/lib/authApi.js` so accounts with `email: null` are never accidentally overwritten.
  8. **Dedicated Full-Page Add Account Route (`/admin/add-account`):**
     - Created `src/components/profile/AddAccountModal.jsx` with RIMT crest, sweep sheen animation, Sign In / Register tabs, password strength meter, and quick-switch account cards.
  9. **Interactive Google Maps Links:**
     - Converted location badges (Karnataka, Telangana, Punjab, etc.) and geographical campus cards in `HiringCompaniesSection.jsx` into clickable Google Maps search links.
   10. **Syntax Fix in `placementStats.js` & Turbopack API Verification:**
      - Resolved `Expected ';', got ':'` Turbopack compilation error at `src/lib/placementStats.js:320` caused by duplicate object properties and redundant closing braces on the `student` payload in `getLivePlacedStudents()`.
      - Validated syntax with `node -c` and verified live API response from `/api/placement-stats/placed-students` returning HTTP 200 with dynamic student profession badges and verified company corporate data.
- **2026-10-05 (Company Management & Talent Profile Enhancements):**
  1. **Sidebar & Module Registry Restoration:** Replaced "Talent Showcase" with "Company Management" in `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` and `src/constants/tokens.js`, binding with the `business` icon and corporate directory descriptors. Updated action ribbon and hero headers in `src/views/CompanyManagement.jsx`.
  2. **Glossy Light Red "View Full Profile" Button & Glossy KPI Cards:** Re-styled the "View Full Profile" CTA on student talent cards into a glossy light red card/button (`h-9 w-full rounded-xl`, glassmorphic light red gradient, crisp crimson typography, glossy light reflection sweep). Re-styled the three mini KPI cards (Projects, Internships, Certificates) with high-gloss gradients, inset highlights, and clean borders while preserving exact compact dimensions.
  3. **Custom Banner & Blue/White Gradient Fallback:** Updated the banner behind student profile cards (`src/views/CompanyManagement.jsx` and `src/components/student/TalentProfileModal.jsx`). Displays student's custom banner image from real database (`banner_url`) when set, and seamlessly falls back to a modern blue and white color gradient banner with radial highlights when unset or if an image error occurs.
  4. **Scroll-Spy Tab Navigation:** Implemented bidirectional scroll-spy in `src/components/student/TalentProfileModal.jsx`. As the user scrolls through the modal, the active tab smoothly updates from **About → Skills → Projects → (Experience) → Certificates → Academics**. When scrolling back up, active tabs smoothly reverse back to About. Smooth auto-centering of active tab button and smooth scrolling on tab click without jitter.
  5. **Strict Real Data Governance:** Academic Record section always renders real Supabase backend metrics (CGPA, Attendance %, Score %, Semester/Batch, Department, Roll Number, Dean's Honors List) with "—" for unset registrar fields — zero fake or dummy data.
- **2026-10-05 (Talent Showcase — Recruiter-Facing Student Portfolio Gallery):**
  1. **New Component — `TalentProfileModal.jsx`:** Created `src/components/student/TalentProfileModal.jsx` (918 lines) — a read-only, recruiter-facing student portfolio viewer. Features: About section, Tech Stack & Skills with deterministic color-coded skill tags, Featured Projects with tech stack/demo links, Certificates with issuing org and dates, Internships with company/role/status, and a Profile Strength gauge (Exceptional/Strong/Developing/Starter). Designed for corporate recruiter consumption with no admin editing capabilities.
  2. **`CompanyManagement.jsx` → Talent Showcase:** Completely rebuilt `src/views/CompanyManagement.jsx` from a static corporate directory into a live, data-driven student talent gallery. Fetches all `APPROVED`/`VERIFIED` students from `/api/admin/requests?status=ALL` with 8-second auto-refresh. Features: profile strength scoring (0-100%), filter pills (All Talent, Exceptional, Strong, Projects, Internships, Certified), department dropdown filter, sort options (strength, name, projects, recent), grid/list view toggle, student portfolio cards with avatar, headline, skills tags, and strength progress bar.
  3. **Sidebar Rename:** Updated `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` — sidebar entry changed from `label: 'Company Management'` / `icon: 'domain'` to `label: 'Talent Showcase'` / `icon: 'person_search'`.
  4. **Module Registry Rename:** Updated `src/constants/tokens.js` — MODULES entry changed from `{ id: 'companies', label: 'Company Management', icon: 'business', shortDesc: 'Corporate Relations & Directory' }` to `{ id: 'companies', label: 'Talent Showcase', icon: 'person_search', shortDesc: 'Student Profiles for Companies' }`.
  5. **DB Layer Enhancement:** Added `getAllStudentInternships()` function to `src/lib/db.js` — aggregates internship records across all approved students by parsing `students.internships` JSONB array and `admin_notes.internships` fallback, enriching each with `student_name`, `student_roll`, and `student_department` metadata.
- **2026-10-03 (Cloudinary Upload Signing Endpoint & Cross-Project Integration):**
  1. **Cloudinary Signing API:** Added `src/app/api/cloudinary/sign/route.js` — `POST` endpoint generates SHA-1 upload signatures using `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`. Validates folder format via regex, returns `{ signature, timestamp, api_key, cloud_name, folder }`. `OPTIONS` handler returns CORS preflight with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
  2. **Environment Configuration:** Added `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` to `.env`. Created `.env.example` documenting server-only Cloudinary secrets.
  3. **LinkedIn Profile Document Upload:** `StudentLinkedInProfileModal.jsx` updated to use `/api/cloudinary/sign` for admin-side document uploads to Cloudinary with roll-number-scoped folders.
  4. **Mobile App Integration:** Configured `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_SIGNING_URL=http://<LAN_IP>:3000/api/cloudinary/sign` in the mobile app's `.env`, resolving the "Cloudinary upload is not configured" error on the Certificates screen.
- **2026-10-01 (Avatar Enhancement, JSX Syntax Fix & Icon Ligature Restoration):**
  1. **Fixed JSX Tag Mismatch in `OnboardingApprovals.jsx`:** Resolved `Syntax Error: Expression expected / Unterminated regexp literal` at `</Modal>` caused by a missing opening avatar container div before the `<img>` tag in the Student Registration Review modal. Added `<div className="w-16 h-16 rounded-2xl bg-primary/10 text-primary font-bold flex items-center justify-center shrink-0 border border-primary/20 overflow-hidden">` wrapper, restoring well-formed JSX structure. Verified production compilation via `next build` (100% success).
  2. **Default Avatar Standardization:** Integrated `/default-avatar.png` fallback across `OnboardingApprovals.jsx` (list table & review detail modal) and `StudentManagement.jsx` (scholar roster & student details drawer). Updated `src/lib/db.js` so newly initialized student records default to `/default-avatar.png`.
  3. **Permanent Icon Ligature Restoration & Font Self-Hosting:** Diagnosed root cause of misplaced overlapping letters (e.g. `school`, `how_to_reg`, `notifications`, `search`, `folder_shared`, `verified`). The Google Material Symbols font failed to bind because `@import` inside PostCSS stylesheets was stripped/unresolved, `<head>` in `layout.jsx` lacked direct stylesheet `<link>` tags, and `.material-symbols-outlined` lacked `font-family: 'Material Symbols Outlined' !important`. Downloaded self-hosted `material-symbols-outlined.woff2` and `.ttf` to `public/fonts/`, configured local `@font-face` with `font-display: block`, added font preloading in `src/app/layout.jsx`, and enforced font properties with user-select protection. Layout and icons restored completely.
- **2026-09-30 (Real-Time Bidirectional Sync, Desert Dossier Theme & WhatsApp Silhouette Avatar):**
  1. **Real-Time Bidirectional Sync Architecture:**
     - Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` in `ADMIN-PANEL-RIMT` and initialized shared client `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` configured with `eventsPerSecond: 10`.
     - Added real-time PostgreSQL subscriptions in `StudentDossierModal.jsx` (`admin-dossier-${studentId}`) listening across `students`, `student_profiles`, `student_projects`, `student_git_projects`, `student_certificates`, `student_internships`, `student_academic_summary`, `student_semester_records`, `student_grades`, and `admin_audit_log`. When a student updates profile, bio, headline, skills, or links from the mobile app, the admin dossier reflects changes in real time with toast alerts.
     - Added real-time subscription in `StudentManagement.jsx` (`admin-student-management-sync`) to auto-refresh scholar table rows without full-page reloads.
     - Updated database migration `20260930_admin_student_dossier.sql` with `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE ...` across all 9 dossier tables and `students` table, plus student update/upsert RLS policies for `student_profiles` and audit log insertion.
  2. **Desert Color Aesthetic & Zero-Transparency Modal Fix:**
     - Defined `'surface-container-lowest': '#FFFFFF'` and desert color tokens (`#FAF6F0`, `#F4EDE4`, `#EFE5D8`, `#DECDBE`, `#DFD3C3`) in `tailwind.config.js`.
     - Eliminated all unwanted backdrop translucency where underlying table text bled through. Modal container now renders with rich desert sand `#FAF6F0`, institutional header in `#F4EDE4`, tabs navigation in `#EFE5D8`, and solid white card interiors with `#DECDBE` borders.
  3. **WhatsApp-Style Human Silhouette Avatar:**
     - Replaced initials fallback ("SO"/"SA") in `StudentDossierModal.jsx` with an authentic, attractive human silhouette demo SVG icon styled identically to WhatsApp's default avatar, embedded in a warm desert-toned container (`#E8DDD2`) with green verified checkmark badge.
  4. **Build & Test Verification:**
     - `npm run build` compiled 100% cleanly (7/7 static and dynamic routes optimized).
     - Full test suite passing 65/65 (26/26 dossier-academic, 21/21 onboarding, 18/18 admin-auth).
- **2026-10-07 (Corporate Company Portal, Registration Screen, Google OAuth & Role-Based Access Control):**
  1. **Dual Portal Authentication (`AuthScreen.jsx` — 1071 lines):** Added corporate company recruiter authentication directly on the login gateway alongside administrative sign-in. Top segmented pill switcher allows switching between **"Institutional Admin"** (maroon `#7A1D27`) and **"Company Portal"** (blue `#0B4EA2`). Quick "Company Access →" button positioned at top right of the card (exactly where the red circle was marked in the user's screenshot). Company Portal shows "Corporate Recruiter Gateway" badge with back-to-admin toggle.
  2. **Corporate Registration & Sign In:** Created dedicated tab-based flows:
     - **Register Company (New):** Company Name*, Recruiter Full Name, Industry/Hiring Sector dropdown (6 options), Official Corporate Email*, Password* fields.
     - **Sign In (Existing):** Email + Password with "Remember corporate session" toggle.
     - **Continue with Google:** Official multi-colored Google SVG icon button → opens interactive Google One-Tap modal with 4 pre-configured corporate accounts (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, TCS) + custom email input for any Google Workspace.
     - All registrations and sign-ins persist directly to the database with JWT tokens and httpOnly cookies.
  3. **Backend API Endpoints (`src/app/api/company/auth/*`):** Created 5 REST route handlers:
     - `POST /api/company/auth/register`: Validates fields, checks email uniqueness, hashes password with PBKDF2-SHA256, creates company in DB, generates 14-day JWT, sets `company_token` httpOnly cookie.
     - `POST /api/company/auth/login`: Authenticates corporate email and password, validates account status (ACTIVE required), generates JWT (7 or 30 day based on remember_me).
     - `POST /api/company/auth/google`: Handles Google OAuth — auto-registers new company if email not found (infers name from domain), signs in existing companies, generates 30-day session.
     - `GET /api/company/auth/me`: Returns sanitized active company recruiter profile, protected by `withAuth(handler, { requiredRole: 'COMPANY' })`.
     - `POST /api/company/auth/logout`: Clears `company_token` cookie.
  4. **Database & In-Memory Store (`src/lib/db.js`):** Added 5 company CRUD functions:
     - `initCompanyDb()`: Seeds default hiring partners (Google LLC, Microsoft, TCS) with PBKDF2-hashed default password `Company@RIMT#2026`.
     - `getCompanyByEmail(email)`: Supabase `ilike` query + in-memory fallback.
     - `getCompanyById(id)`: Supabase `eq` query + in-memory fallback.
     - `createCompany({...})`: Creates company record in both Supabase and in-memory store with auto-generated ID, avatar fallback, timestamps.
     - `getAllCompanies()`: Returns all companies from in-memory store.
     - `getMemoryCompanies()`: Internal accessor for `global.__RIMT_DB_COMPANIES` array.
  5. **Client-Side Auth API (`src/lib/authApi.js`):** Added 3 company client methods:
     - `companyRegister({company_name, recruiter_name, email, password, industry})`: POST to `/api/company/auth/register`, stores JWT in localStorage, saves account session.
     - `companyLogin({email, password, remember_me})`: POST to `/api/company/auth/login`, stores JWT.
     - `companyGoogleLogin({email, name, avatar_url, company_name})`: POST to `/api/company/auth/google`, stores JWT.
- **2026-10-07 (Role Isolation, Auto-Repair Sanitization & Dual-Portal Account Strictness):**
  1. **Sidebar Locked Modules Exclusion (Image 1 fix):** Updated `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` so when logged in as a Corporate Recruiter (`COMPANY` role), locked operational modules (`Onboarding Approvals`, `Student Management`, `Drive Management`, `Training Management`, `Internship Monitoring`, `Report Generation`) are completely excluded from the DOM. Only **Company Management** and **Placement Statistics** are rendered under "Core Modules".
  2. **Top-Right Profile Menu Account Switching Isolation (Image 2 fix):** Updated `src/components/profile/ProfileMenu.jsx` to enforce strict isolation using `isAdminAccount` and `isCompanyAccount`. Company logins only ever see other corporate company accounts; institutional admin logins only ever see other institutional admin accounts.
  3. **Dual-Portal Auth Chooser Strict Isolation & Auto-Repair (Images 3 & 4 fix):**
     - Fixed bug in `src/lib/authApi.js` `saveAccountSession()` where `company_name` was defaulting to `fullName` even for admins.
     - Added `isAdminAccount(acc)` and `isCompanyAccount(acc)` predicate classifiers in `src/lib/authApi.js`.
     - Added auto-repair on `getSavedAccounts()`: if any stored record for Raj Kumar, Sagrika, or `@rimt.ac.in` admin has legacy `company_name` or corporate fields in `localStorage`, it is automatically stripped, sanitized, and updated in `localStorage` as pure `ADMIN`.
     - In `src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx`, completely segregated `adminSavedAccounts` and `companySavedAccounts`. Raj Kumar exclusively appears in the Institutional Admin chooser and can never appear in the Company Portal chooser.
     - Replaced asymmetrical sub-header row with a clean, centered, balanced gateway indicator for both Institutional Admin and Company Portal gateways.
- **2026-10-06 (Corporate Recruiter Portal & Dual-Portal Authentication Integration):**
  1. **Dual-Portal Auth Architecture:** Embedded corporate recruiter login and registration directly alongside the existing institutional admin login in `src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx`.
  2. **Pill-Tab Switcher & Mode Separation:** Added dual-tab switcher: **Institutional Admin** (maroon `#6B0018`) vs **Company Portal** (navy `#0B4EA2`).
     - Extract tokens from both `admin_token` and `company_token` cookies.
  7. **Role-Based Access Control (`Sidebar.jsx`, `page.jsx`):**
     - `Sidebar.jsx` accepts `userRole` prop and defines `companyAllowedModules = ['companies', 'statistics']`.
     - Locked modules show padlock 🔒 icon replacing normal icon, "Staff" badge, muted styling, and tooltip `(Staff Only)`.
     - Sidebar brand card adapts: "RIMT Corporate" + "Recruiter Portal" badge (blue theme) vs "RIMT Trust" + "T&P Admin Portal" (maroon theme).
     - Footer shows "Company Access — Verified Corporate Partner" for company users.
     - Active module styling uses blue gradient for company, maroon gradient for admin.
     - `page.jsx` renders `CompanyLockedModuleView` when `isCompany && activeModule !== 'companies' && activeModule !== 'statistics'`.
     - `CompanyLockedModuleView`: Premium lock card with amber lock icon, "Staff-Restricted Operational Module" badge, access privileges checklist (✅ Talent Pool, ✅ Statistics, 🔒 Approvals), and two CTAs (Browse Talent Pool, Placement Statistics).
     - Company users default to `activeModule: 'companies'` on login.
     - For institutional staff (Raj Kumar, Sagrika), all 8 modules remain completely open.
  8. **Dedicated Routes:**
     - `/company` → `src/app/company/page.jsx` — Renders `AdminPortalDashboard` inside `AuthGuard` with `initialPortalType="company"`.
     - `/company/auth` → `src/app/company/auth/page.jsx` — Standalone company auth screen, redirects to `/company` after authentication.
     - `/admin/auth` → Existing admin auth page.
  9. **AuthGuard Enhancement (`AuthGuard.jsx`):** Updated to accept `initialPortalType` prop, forwarding it to `AuthScreen` so `/company` routes default to the Company Portal tab.
- **2026-09-30 (Admin-Managed Student Dossier & Strict Manual Academic Control):**
  1. **Database Schema & RLS:** Added migration `supabase/migrations/20260930_admin_student_dossier.sql` creating 9 tables: `public.student_profiles`, `public.student_projects`, `public.student_git_projects`, `public.student_certificates`, `public.student_internships`, `public.student_academic_summary`, `public.student_semester_records`, `public.student_grades`, and `public.admin_audit_log`. Implemented `public.is_admin()` and `public.current_student_id()` helper functions. RLS ensures full admin CRUD and read-only student access to their own records where `is_visible = true`, with ZERO student write paths. Private bucket `student-certificates` created with signed URL access protocol.
  2. **Strict Manual-Only Academic Governance:** Enforced institutional policy where CGPA (0.00 – 10.00), overall attendance % (0.00 – 100.00), backlogs, semester SGPA, and subject grades are written strictly and exclusively by administrators. Completely eliminated all auto-derivation, triggers, cron jobs, and edge functions. Unset values display as "—" (never fake 0 or 8.65). Changes to grades do not recalculate CGPA. Confirmation modal displaying Old vs New comparison diff is mandatory before saving academic records. Every mutation is logged in `admin_audit_log`.
  3. **Removed Automation:** Removed hash-based synthetic CGPA generator (`8.15 + hashSum`), removed fallback `8.65` and `94.8%` attendance numbers, and removed synthetic SGPA calculations from `src/lib/db.js` and views.
  4. **Frontend Dossier UI:** Built `src/components/student/StudentDossierModal.jsx` featuring 7 tabs: Overview, Projects, Git Projects, Certificates, Internships, Academics, and Activity Log. Includes modal forms for section additions, inline visibility toggles, drag-and-drop sort reordering, bulk grade grid entry, pre-save confirmation modal, live audit log viewer, and clean printable PDF export layout.
  5. **Cross-Module Integrations:**
     - `src/views/StudentManagement.jsx`: Added live `CGPA` and `Attendance` table columns, "Open Dossier" button on rows, and detail drawer academic badges.
     - `src/views/InternshipMonitoring.jsx`: Added live fetching from `/api/admin/internships`.
     - `src/app/api/admin/requests/[id]/route.js`: Enhanced with comprehensive dossier payload and section mutation dispatcher with actor tracking.
     - `src/app/api/admin/internships/route.js`: Created route to serve live student internships.
  6. **Automated Testing:** Created `tests/dossier-academic.test.mjs` verifying boundary validation, audit logging, section CRUD, and manual CGPA retention after grades change. All 26/26 tests passed (total test suite: 65/65 passing).
- **2026-09-30 (Fixed Admin Accounts & Signup Lockdown):** Eliminated open admin signup permanently. Hardcoded two authorized administrators — **Raj Kumar** (HOD BCA, password `BCAHOD`) and **Sagrika** (Vice HOD BCA, password `VICEHOD`) — with PBKDF2-SHA256 salted hashes (`rimt-salt-key`, 10,000 iterations). `POST /api/admin/auth/signup` now returns `403 SIGNUP_DISABLED` unconditionally. Login route validates `name` + `password` against Supabase `admins` table with in-memory fallback. `AuthScreen.jsx` updated to Sign In only with warm desert theme (no signup tabs/links). Cleaned up demo/placeholder admin references across `ProfileMenu.jsx`, `ProfileModal.jsx`, and `ProfileTab.jsx`. Migration: `supabase/migrations/20260930_fixed_admin_accounts.sql`.
- **2026-09-30 (LinkedIn-Style Scholar Dossier & Profile Tracker):** Built comprehensive LinkedIn-style student dossier inspection system for admin portal:
  1. **`StudentLinkedInProfileModal.jsx`** (`src/components/student/`): Full-screen LinkedIn hero cover banner, 120px verified avatar with status badge, legal name, roll number, professional headline, location pin, quick-action buttons (Direct Call, WhatsApp, Email), Academic Score & CGPA tracker with semester SGPA breakdown chart, narrative About/Bio section with skills tags, Featured Projects portfolio cards (GitHub-synced with category, tech stack, and demo links), and Verified Documents vault with live Supabase `student_documents` integration and instant in-modal PDF/image previewer.
  2. **Student Management Integration:** Added LinkedIn Profile row buttons and detail drawer card in `StudentManagement.jsx` for every student in the directory.
  3. **Onboarding Approvals Integration:** Added LinkedIn Profile inspection buttons in `OnboardingApprovals.jsx` review table rows and detail modal for pre-approval dossier review.
  4. **Backend API Enhancement:** `GET /api/admin/requests/[id]` now returns enriched `dossier` object (bio, headline, cgpa, semester_scores, projects, skills, documents). `PATCH /api/admin/requests/[id]` supports live admin overrides of scholar bio, phone, academic metrics.
  5. **DB Layer:** Added `getStudentDocuments()`, `getStudentDossier()`, and `updateStudentDossier()` to `src/lib/db.js`.
  6. **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20260930_add_student_bio_and_academic_score.sql` — adds `bio`, `headline`, `cgpa`, `academic_score`, `banner_url`, `projects`, `skills`, `semester_scores` columns to `students` table.
- **2026-09-30 (Student App Bio Field):** Added `bio` state and multiline text input to `EditProfileScreen.jsx` in the mobile app (`APP-RIMIT`). Updated `authService.js` to accept and persist `bio` to Supabase. Cross-compatible with admin LinkedIn-style dossier tracker.
- **2026-09-29 (Admin Panel Authentication — NEW-FEATURE.md Complete):** Implemented comprehensive Admin Authentication and Session Management for the T&P Admin Portal:
  1. **Database Schema & Adapter:** Added `public.admins` schema in `schema.sql` with unique index on normalized email, active status constraints, and UUID primary keys. Added `getAdminByEmail`, `getAdminById`, `checkAdminEmailExists`, `createAdmin`, and `updateAdmin` in `src/lib/db.js` with in-memory persistence and Supabase synchronization.
  2. **API Endpoints (`src/app/api/admin/auth/*`):** Created 7 REST route handlers for signup, login, logout, me, profile-pic, change-password, and check-email.
  3. **Security Middleware:** Enhanced `withAuth` in `src/lib/middleware.js` to extract tokens from cookies or authorization headers, and authenticate admin roles and active status.
  4. **Frontend UI & Guards:** Created `AuthScreen.jsx`, `AuthGuard.jsx`, `ProfileMenu.jsx`, `ProfileModal.jsx`. Integrated `ProfileTab.jsx` into the main module registry.
  5. **Verification & Tests:** `tests/admin-auth.test.mjs` (18/18 pass). `tests/onboarding.test.mjs` (21/21 pass). Production build compiled 100% cleanly.
- **2026-09-29 (Document & Storage Fix):** Fixed 3 critical backend blockers for student document upload. Created migration `supabase/migrations/20260929_fix_document_storage_and_tables.sql`. All 21/21 onboarding tests pass.
- **2026-09-29:** Fixed critical "Student record not found" bug in `src/lib/db.js`. Updated `db.js` to send verified columns to Supabase. Added `.env.local` with Supabase credentials. Enabled student avatar display.
- **2026-09-29:** Normalized student aliases across the admin DB layer. Verified 21/21 onboarding tests.
- **2026-09-29:** Student registrations and counts now use live Supabase records only. Added `REVOKED` state, reason, endpoint, and lockout flow.
- **2026-09-29 00:05:** Fixed `rejectStudent()` / `approveStudent()` persistence bug. All 15/15 tests passing.
- **2026-09-28 23:50:** Implemented real-time auto-synchronization and removed all fake mock data.
- **2026-09-28 23:30:** Synced docs with simplified registration flow. 4 fields only.
- **2026-09-28 22:37:** Cleaned up workspace. Only `ADMIN.md` remains as master memory.
- **2026-09-28 22:20:** Created `OnboardingApprovals.jsx` view.
- **2026-09-28 22:15:** Built Next.js 14 API route handlers.
